<h1>About</h1>
<ul>
<li>A GIF creator developed using the Giphy API to dynamically add superhero gifs to the page. In addition to the API, jQuery, Javascript, Bootstrap, and HTML5/CSS3 are being used to build the application. The user is able to find GIFs using either the preselected players buttons or has the ability to add their own player. Buttons respond to click events to manipulte the DOM adding either a new player button, a new set of relevant GIFs, or responding to a gif click to animate or pause a GIF animation.
